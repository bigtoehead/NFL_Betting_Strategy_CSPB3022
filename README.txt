NFL_betting_strategy_test.ipynb = adjusting the strategy by investigating just the Miami Dolphins
and also changing the test dataset from only 2013 to the years 2004 thru 2013. Also, his is where
I tested the home_win_delta thoeory that a more linear response could show correlation with the 
Line value. This is discussd and highlighted in the powerpoint and video This further analysis
was done for the discussion section of the write up

nfl*lines.csv = raw data files I used for my analysis

all_data.csv = consolidated data (done by the NFL*.ipynb notebooks)

2013_data.csv = test dataset (gets overwritten depending on what *.ipynb is used)
